# Usage
## Prerequisites

Our codebase was written for Python 3.8.10; other version may very well work but are untested.

We recommend constructing a virtual environment for dependency management:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

From here, dependency installation can be automatically handled with a single command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you'd like to synthesize generated RTL using our Make flow, you'll need a VCS installation and of course a valid license. Point the `VCS_HOME` environment variable to your top-level VCS installation directory (the executable path should be `$(VCS_HOME)/bin/vcs`). We derived our power and area estimates using Vivado; reports for the provided pre-trained models are available (see below).

## Creating BTHOWeN Models
All relevant code lives in the `software_model/` directory. Natively supported datasets are MNIST, Ecoli, Iris, Letter, Satimage, Shuttle, Vehicle, Vowel, and Wine.

`train_swept_models.py` is the primary script for programmatic model sweeping. It allows for specification of Bloom filter and encoding parameters; run with `--help` for more details.  
Example usage: `./train_swept_models.py MNIST --filter_inputs 28 --filter_entries 1024 --filter_hashes 2 --bits_per_input 2`  
`--filter_inputs`, `--filter_entries`, `--filter_hashes`, and `--bits_per_input` can all be provided with multiple values, in which case all permutations are tried.  
Run-to-run variation in accuracy is expected, particularly on small models. This is largely a result of the random input mapping.  
*Note*: Dataset names are not case-sensitive

`evaluate.py` runs inference on a pre-trained model - invocation takes the form `./evaluate.py <model_fname> <dset_name>`.

`calc_model_size.py` is a small script which gives the total Bloom filter size (in KiB; 1 KiB = 1024B) of the specified pre-trained model.

`convert_dset.py` is the script we used to binarize the MNIST dataset as an input to our RTL testbenches for checking correctness. You're unlikely to need this one, but we provide it for completeness.

## Producing RTL for Pre-Trained BTHOWeN Models
All relevant code lives in the `rtl/` directory.

We provide a Makefile for generating the RTL. Invoking `make` with no arguments will generate RTL for a sample model (our small MNIST model), and then attempt to build the RTL and testbenches. To generate the RTL without building it, run `make template`.  
The Makefile also allows for the model file, number of hash units in the accelerator, and data bus width to be specified as optional command-line arguments. So for instance, you could run:
```
make template MODEL=../software_model/selected_models/letter.pickle.lzma HASH_UNITS=2 BUS_WIDTH=32
```
If `HASH_UNITS` is left as the default (-1), the script will choose the smallest number of hash units possible without causing the device to be memory-bound. This is a function of the exact model architecture and the bus width.

SystemVerilog sources are generated using the [Mako templating library](https://www.makotemplates.org/) from the `.sv.mako` sources under `rtl/mako_srcs/`, and written under `rtl/sv_srcs/`.

# Replication
## Software Models
Models with identical sizes to those mentioned in Table 3 of the paper (replicated below) can be trained with:
    ./train_swept_models.py <Dataset name> --filter_inputs <Bits/Filter>  --filter_entries <Entries/Filter> --filter_hashes <Hashes/Filter> --bits_per_input <Bits/Input>
Run-to-run variation in input mapping may cause results to not exactly match, particularly on the very small datasets (e.g. Wine). The pretrained models used in the paper are available under `software_model/selected_models/`.


| **Model Name** | **Bits/Input** | **Bits/Filter** | **Entries/Filter** | **Hashes/Filter** | **Size (KiB)** | **Test Accuracy** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MNIST-Small | 2 | 28 | 1024 | 2 | 70.0 | 0.934 |
| MNIST-Medium | 3 | 28 | 2048 | 2 | 210 | 0.943 |
| MNIST-Large | 6 | 49 | 8192 | 4 | 960 | 0.952 |
| Ecoli | 10 | 10 | 128 | 2 | 0.875 | 0.875 |
| Iris | 3 | 2 | 128 | 1 | 0.281 | 0.980 |
| Letter | 15 | 20 | 2048 | 4 | 78.0 | 0.900 |
| Satimage | 8 | 12 | 512 | 4 | 9.00 | 0.880 |
| Shuttle | 9 | 27 | 1024 | 2 | 2.63 | 0.999 |
| Vehicle | 16 | 16 | 256 | 3 | 2.25 | 0.762 |
| Vowel | 15 | 15 | 256 | 4 | 3.44 | 0.900 |
| Wine | 9 | 13 | 128 | 3 | 0.422 | 0.983 |

## RTL Power and Area
Replicating RTL power/energy/area results requires a Vivado license. If you encounter timing violations, set `intermediate_buffer = False` on line 19 of `rtl/mako_srcs/hash.sv.mako`; this will insert an additional stage in the pipeline. We needed to do this for our medium and large MNIST models.  
We also provide the Vivado reports which were used in our analysis under `rtl/synthesis_reports`.
